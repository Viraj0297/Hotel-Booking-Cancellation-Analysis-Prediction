# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Analysis-Prediction
This project explores hotel booking data through extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques to derive actionable insights. 

### Key Features:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with insights from hotel booking patterns.
- Interactive visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Project Overview:
The dataset contained various features related to hotel reservations, such as booking lead time, guest demographics, room type, special requests, and booking modifications. We explored the relationships between these variables and cancellation rates to understand key drivers influencing cancellations.

## Project Structure
- **notebooks/**: Contains the Jupyter notebook that walks through EDA, visualizations.
- **data/**: Contains the hotel booking dataset.
- **images/**: Stores visualizations and charts generated from the data.
- **src/**: Python scripts for data processing and model building.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Results & Insights
- The analysis shows that 37% of reservations are canceled, significantly affecting hotel revenue. City hotels have a higher booking volume than resort hotels, likely due to price differences.
- August sees the highest number of both confirmed and canceled bookings, while January experiences the most cancellations overall.
- Higher average daily rates (ADR) directly correlate with an increase in cancellations, especially at resort hotels during peak periods.
- Portugal has the highest rate of cancellations, with 46% of bookings made via online travel agencies.

## Suggestions
- Implementing dynamic pricing strategies to lower cancellation rates during peak periods.
- Targeted marketing campaigns in January to reduce high cancellation rates.
- Enhancing services in high-cancellation regions, especially in Portugal.
